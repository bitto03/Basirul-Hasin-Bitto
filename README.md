##  About Me

I’m a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student with hands-on experience in building real-world IoT systems, embedded solutions, and automation projects. I enjoy combining hardware with software to solve problems in unique and efficient ways.

From making robots that follow lines or hands, to smart farming and water filtration systems powered by solar energy—I like to push boundaries and make impactful innovations. My projects often involve Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, GPS modules, GSM communication, and sensor integration.

Thanks for stopping by!
